Low Physical Effort

The Marketplace GUI follows Principle 6: Low Physical Effort. A user does not need to make much physical effort to move their mouse when navigating through the prompts, since the buttons are close to each other. It is also possible to move through many prompts by clicking the enter key, which is even less effort when using a standard keyboard. However, there are some repetitive actions, since the user has to add quite a bit of information about the item they hope to sell, and click enter each time.

Simple and Intuitive Use

The EventGUI code satisfies pretty much all the design principles, in particular Simple and Intuitive Use, as there are only roughly 6 different options, each is descriptive, and every text field clearly lays out the format of the required info, so little work is really required to use the calendar.

Tolerance for Error

The journal feature of Ufinders adheres to the principle tolerance for error. For instance, it provides the fail safe features of naming a journal entry with no title, “Untitled” followed by some numbers.  By doing so it ensures each journal entry has a title even when the user does not provide one. Another way journal adheres to this principle is providing a warning when the user tries to give an entry the same title as another entry that already exists. It warns the user and prompts them to type a new title. As a result, the user will be able to differentiate one entry from another.

Flexibility in Use

In the future, we can implement a speaking option that allows the questions asked for users to be spoken aloud for those who have trouble with seeing. Additionally, we can implement a speaking option that allows users to say what they want to fill in. The speaking option would transfer what the speakers says and input it.
Our program is really simple right now, there are a lot of fancy designs we have not implemented like making the input options easier for users to use (so that they don’t have to type too much things). Also, we need to learn and study further if we want to implement functions like speaking aloud option or speaking into speakers to transfer what we say.

Equitable Use

Through the use of encapsulation, we have managed to achieve certain provisions for privacy, security and safety for all our users. Sensitive information, such as the user’s passwords when logging into our system is kept inside a private database to increase the difficulty of accidentally displaying unwanted, sensitive data.
However, in the future, we would like to implement encryption for these kinds of sensitive data in order to create an even more secure system for our users. Another change we should implement is a narrator and text-enlarger for our program as to ensure equivalent means of use for visually-impaired users.

Perceptible Information

The GUI throughout the program remains simple and decluttered to ease the amount of information a user has to take in while navigating through the program regardless of whether it is their first time using the program or not. Buttons remain large and straight forward at the center of the pop up window to ease accessibility. One additional feature that could aid in furthering this principle is including pictorial representations of the purpose of each button to further reduce ambiguity.

Size and Space for Approach and Use

While this principle mainly pertains to the physical accessibility of a sign which in the context of software like our project is not very relevant, a different interpretation can be inferred in terms of accessibility on different platforms and operating systems. The GUI and file system was tailored to work with both MacOS and Windows. It should also work on Linux, however this was not tested as no members own a computer running Linux. One way to improve this program to further this design principle is to make it work on smartphones. 

2. The program UFinders would be marketed towards University of Toronto students. Calendar, marketplace, and journal programs are already available out there, but this is the only program that has all of it in one place. It is a program to help students organize their events and courses on a calendar, improve mental health through journaling, make money by selling unwanted products, and find affordable products on campus. The event section of the program considers events happening at the University of Toronto and adds them to the calendar. Also, the marketplace section of the program can choose which campuses you are looking to buy products from and from which campus you are selling. The campuses include UTSC, UTM, and UTSG--specific to University of Toronto so that every user knows they are buying from a fellow student..
3. Since our target customers were UofT students, it would be less likely for students of other universities to use our program as the current events and usability functions mainly target UofT students. However, it would be doable if we tweak the program later on; for example, because our program is extendable, we could add campuses for items. It can even be extended to other occupations other than student as long as we alter our program. Another demographic group that would be less likely to use our code would be people who don’t trust technology and rather do things in-person or manually.
