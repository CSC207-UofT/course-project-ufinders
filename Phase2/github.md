Some of our group had a bit of trouble trying to merge our branches on github during Phase 1. Github wouldnâ€™t let us merge our branch saying that it had too many conflicts to do so.

For Phase 2, we made use of the pull, push and merge feature and committed our code into Github to keep our code up to date. We made more branches with more specific tasks so that the main branch was constantly updated and conflicts were less likely. We also chose more specific names so everyone knew what each pull request meant.
