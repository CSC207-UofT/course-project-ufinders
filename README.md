## Welcome to UFind!

Our Phase 2 written work is in the Phase2 folder, inside is an updated specification that directs you to how our program works. Our updated CRC cards are in the CRC_Card folder.

Below is directions on how our program works:

How User Works:

When the user initially starts the program they are greeted by a screen that asks them to either sign-in or sign-up to proceed. In order to gain access to the events, journal or marketplace section of the program a user must have an account so realistically the first choice for a new user would be to create an account. Once they set up their username and password they can proceed to login with their new credentials. The program verifies that the credentials the user entered are in fact correct based on the local data stored by the program in the documents folder. If the credentials are valid the user gains access to the feature selection page where they can open each corresponding section via buttons. The user can choose to have one or multiple windows open at the same time. 
 
How Events Works:

When the program is run, select Pick a Date to open the calendar. Add Event opens a pop up window where one can enter the time, title, and date of an event they wish added to the calendar. Clear calendar clears all events on the calendar. Search event opens a pop up window where one can enter keywords pertaining to events from the UofT website they would be interested in seeing. Double clicking a date on the calendar displays all the events for that day, giving users the option to delete or edit the events for that day. Opting to edit an event opens a window where users can edit the time, title, and date of the event.


How Journal Works:

Run the JournalUI. The main menu window will pop up from which you can select to add, delete, view/ edit a journal entry or exit the journal program. For the action of adding, deleting, and viewing/editing a journal entry, another window will pop up from which you can do what you want to do and either click ok to complete the action or cancel if you change your mind about the action you initially wanted to do. When you click exit, you leave the journal program.
 
How Marketplace Works:
 
When the Marketplace is selected after running the main class, it will ask you whether you want to sell, buy, remove an item, or exit the program. If you pick sell, then you will be prompted to answer a list of questions in regard to the item you’re selling. If you select buy, then you will be able to search and filter your search to find a list of items you can choose from. If you choose remove, then you will be prompted to enter the item you’re selling and its password so that you can remove the item from the program. When you are done, you will be able to choose if you want to exit the program.
