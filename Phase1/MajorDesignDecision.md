A significant decision made for the journal section is making pop-up windows for the different actions that the user wants to do in the journal. The journal entries are stored in text files, and initially, I was going to allow the user to view these text files and edit them. However, that defeats the purpose of the journal program since the user can do that independently. So I decided to implement a pop-up window that makes the journal program easier to use, and it's not something the user can do on their own. Anything the user wants to do in a journal, such as choosing what to do, adding, deleting, and viewing/adding an entry, they do so through pop-up windows.

We implemented the factory design pattern when creating items for the marketplace section. With this, we can not only limit and streamline how to create different items to be stored in the database as we are using enums as parameters, but we also pass that responsibility of choosing and creating items to ItemCreator - promoting loose coupling for our code.
