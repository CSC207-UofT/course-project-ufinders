1. How can you test a pop-up window through junit testing instead of directly?
2. Why does serialization delete the old items I have stored sometimes when I rerun the program? Will that be a concern/is there a way to solve this?
3. How to remove an item from a serialized array list?
4. Should we split up User_Controls? It feels like it might be doing too much and Iâ€™m also a bit concerned that it depends too much on Searcher and Filter.
5. Is the factory design pattern appropriate for Items?
