We decided to package by feature, since each component of the program, such as the marketplace, calendar, and journal, does not depend on each other. For example, making changes to how the journal functions requires no modifications to the marketplace and calendar. Also, if someone wants to see the code for just the journal section, they can do so easily. Within the marketplace we again packaged by feature, to simplify the groups of classes created for design patterns.
