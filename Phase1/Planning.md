Thaksha:

I implemented the journal section of the program allowing for users to add, delete and view/edit an entry. I also implemented the database for where the journal entries are being stored. Also, I tested all the methods in all of the classes of the journal section.

Planning to do: Code for when the user decides to not do the action that they wanted to do.  Also, deal with exceptions such as when the user wants to use the same title for two different entries.

I have modified User_Controls to allow users to remove items, modified ItemManager so items can be removed using some password they’ve set and let it create different types of posts to Database and added serialization to Database. I’ve also implemented some tests for some of the methods, but there are some I still have to look into to test. I plan to allow for proper deletion of items that were serialized, clean up ItemManager to match with Database and User_Controls and figure out GUI.

I’ve written code in the Marketplace for User_Controls, Searcher, Sorter, and all the filters and comparators for Item. I have also written tests for all the classes I worked on, excluding User_Controls both because it was easy to test from the terminal and because I wanted to focus on writing all the other classes. I plan to work on adapting User_Controls to work with a GUI and work on fixing any problems with the classes I wrote.

Implemented Factory design pattern for item, added tests for it and edited up Results to adhere to the changes made to the rest of the program
Want to work on GUI, potentially fix any problems with Item, maybe implement regex for certain parameters (e.g. Textbook’s course attributes)

Marton

Implemented the User login and sign-up system adhering to the persistent file and data system used throughout the program by establishing directories used to store user data
Plan on working on a full GUI involving Java libraries to further integrate program sections and remove command-line interaction.
