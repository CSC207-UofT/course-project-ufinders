1. Following clean architecture has saved me a lot of time since making changes to one class prevented me from having to make too many classes.
2. Testing the methods individually allowed me to account for other scenarios that the method could be used but currently are not.
3. Was able to successfully implement serialization to Database which can  allow the items to be stored and accessed for usage by users.
4. It was difficult to figure out the best way to implement searcher, and using the strategy design pattern really simplified that process.
